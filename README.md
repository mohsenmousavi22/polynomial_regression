# polynomial_regression

This mini project is an analytical comparison between Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression,
focusing on their capabilities to predict the salary associated with a new position in a company.

Through this endeavor, I aim to investigate the performance and suitability of these regression models given the context of salary prediction.
